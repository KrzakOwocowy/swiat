#005 the wall
    realising the threat of THE HORDE, many nations from the region funded the construction of extensive forticitaion along the border of their influence, however before it was ready the HORDE
    started penetrating the wall leading to nations abandoning the project to focus on defending their own borders. its only effective on the border of the teutonic knights
    was also presumably used for selecting the location of the central facility and is a part of its huge defensive system
#006 northern forts
    the northern european countries were much more sucessful in building a fort line against the horde, mainly due to magic help from the wizards and gnomes who joined forces to build it.
    as a result the wall stopped furthern horde expansion in the region
